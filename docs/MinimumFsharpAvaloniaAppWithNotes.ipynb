    "Teechnically there is a `Avalonia.Themes.Default.DefaultTheme` that is built in. However, in my experience, it does not help. A new window will be transparent and you really are unable to use it. So a theme _HAS_ to be applied to be practical. So far, the only way to get it into the mix is to create a type based on the Application. The `SimpleTheme` is what I have used for my testing. The themes are seperate nuget packages, so you have to grab it and open it.\n",

    "## Avalonia App\n",
    "Avalonia has actually been around for more then 10 years. As what happens with long lived projects, there is a lot of information that unavailable (404s and the like) or just plain wrong because of progression of the code base. Version 11 also bought some pretty large structure changes and new capabilities and that has been fun to naviagte. In addition, there is not a clear presentation of how Avalonia actually works. Like from a conceptual view or even a high technical view that is helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some research and digging and some AI conversations about Avalonia I am starting to gain some understanding. The ceremony involved and some of the values needed have really confused me. What I discovered is that Avalonia is based on the [.NET Generic Host](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/generic-host?tabs=appbuilder) This model is still not explained rather well but I did find some materials that helped. \n",

    "\n",
    "Reading through these turned on some light bulbs because I started to associate what Avalonia was doing with things like \"lifetimes\" and the appBuilder stuff. So once the HOST app is ready and the descriptions of the UI have been feed in, Avalonia creates 'pipelines' or instruction sets describing the intended screen or something like that and then feeds those instruction into Skia (SkiaSharp) that uses the GPU if available and shows the pixels on the sceen back in the window. PDF's can be extracted, which my current understanding is that is actually because of Skia and come from it. PNG and Bitmap can also be generated I think. That will be in future research experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Lifetimes\n",
    "Again, the lifetimes are a reflection of the .Net Host basis. The avalonia lifetimes are based on if the code is running in a desktop enviroment or on a phone or in wasm, etc. Xploring more into those things will come in the future. So after the `OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` the running app needs to know _how_ it is running. That is the match. This section will get expanded in future versions of this script. I added the printfn just to see where that showed up, if anywhere and to tell me I got to that point when running dotnet `fsi script.fsx`. "
