# The experience of getting FSharp.Formatting working!

I have tried actually several times to use [FSharp.Formatting](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharp.Formatting/) over the past 10 years of exploring F#. Never got it to a useful stage until today *(2024-03-26)*. Been quite a frustrating experience. One would think that the tool that creates documentation would be well documented! There is plenty of information there, it is just a lot to take in when one is inexperienced in most things. 

Now that I got it working locally and in github pages with a custom domain, things should be quite a bit more smooth. Hopefully I can bring a noobie persective to the flow of the help docs and provide some PR's. I already have cleaned up a couple typos and such that tripped me up. 

Anyway, now I can spew my thoughts for all posterity. Tackling [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/) next!
